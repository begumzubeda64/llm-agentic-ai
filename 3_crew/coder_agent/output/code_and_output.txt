total = 0
for i in range(10000):
    term = 1 / (2 * i + 1)  # Generating the terms: 1, 1/3, 1/5, 1/7, ...
    if i % 2 == 0:
        total += term  # Add term if i is even
    else:
        total -= term  # Subtract term if i is odd

final_result = total * 4  # Multiply the total by 4
print(final_result)  # Printing the final result
```
